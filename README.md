# SantanderProductRecommendation
In this competition, you are provided with 1.5 years of customers behavior data from Santander bank to predict what new products customers will purchase. The data starts at 2015-01-28 and has monthly records of products a customer has, such as “credit card”, “savings account”, etc. You will predict what additional products a customer will get in the last month, 2016-06-28, in addition to what they already have at 2016-05-28. These products are the columns named: ind_(xyz)_ult1, which are the columns #25 – #48 in the training data. You will predict what a customer will buy in addition to what they already had at 2016-05-28.  So we have to select which among the 24 products a user will buy in the 2016-06-28 with respect to what he already has in the previous month.
